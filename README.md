<h1> JS Development </h1>
• Task-12 is a Major Task, will take significant time, will also add Firebase Auth after all tests are passed when Shopping, and all pages like Cart, Profile and More are Complete... <br>
• Created Profile, Orders and Contact Page, but not yet started designing.. <br>
• Stopped Using Many JSs like nike.js, mh.js for each item and started using Functions in 1 JS (main.js) for low Page Load Speeds. <br>
• Using TailwindCSS for Design and also using Tailwind Framework Tailblocks.. <br>
• Task-11 also on Hold, will first try completing Task-11, then get onto Task-12 <br>
• May also do React.js & Vue.js (without tasks, code freelancing)<br>
• May also change Site from <a href="https://avmcgames.ml/">https://avmcgames.ml/</a> to <a href="https://avisbeastmc.ml/">https://js.avisbeastmc.ml/</a><br>
